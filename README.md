SSLLMs: Semantic Security for LLM-GPTs
Welcome to the SSLLMs (Semantic Security for LLM-GPTs) project! This is an open-source initiative focused on researching, understanding, and improving the semantic security logic for Language Learning Models, particularly Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs).

Project Overview
With the rapid advancement in AI and machine learning, GPTs have become more sophisticated and widely used. However, this progression brings forth unique challenges, particularly in maintaining the security of these systems. SSLLMs aims to address these challenges by developing robust security measures through the study and application of semantic security logic.

Why It Matters
The new wave of puzzle solvers turned logic hackers poses a significant threat to the integrity and confidentiality of LLM-GPTs. These individuals, often motivated by curiosity or the thrill of the challenge, exploit semantic vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or manipulate outputs. Conversely, there's a growing community dedicated to fortifying these models against such vulnerabilities through advanced semantic language logic. SSLLMs serves as a battleground and a collaboration platform for both sides, driving innovation in security protocols.

Contributions and Discussions
We encourage open discussions and contributions from all corners of the tech world - whether you're a security expert, AI researcher, logic hacker, or just someone interested in the field.
